## Hi there 👋
I'm Adrian Markowski, check out my profile.

## 🪧 About me 
I'm a Cybersecurity student on AGH UST in Cracow.
At university with a group of friends we created a research group in the field of game development. Now I'm an active member of the council of this group. Our current aim is to finish an online mobile game with many minigames so you could compete with friends in free time. I'm a part of team currently working on minigame called "Czołgi".




## ⚙️🪛 My projects 
In free time of studies try to improve my programming skills by developing some projects.

### 📊 https://github.com/AdrMAr5/stock_tracker 
Simple ETL requesting a currencies exchange rate and saving into a database. This project teached me some basics of data collecting, transforming and saving into database. I used Prefect to schedule flow and complete tasks.

### 🏓 https://github.com/AdrMAr5/Pong 
My interpretation of this classic game created in Unity. This project made me win a prize for best pong in research group's contest for best pong game 🥇.

## 😍 Hobbies
* 🚲 I really like to spend time actively for example cycling, strolling and other stuff like that. 
* 🛠️ I like creating things manually, repairing broken ones.   
   Probably that is why in high school with my friend we were creating our own robot: more here(when I'll manage to write about it).
* 🍷 Home cider production. Don't be afraid - it's legal 😂.   
   Evereyone likes it so you should try it too. I swear it's better than boughten.
